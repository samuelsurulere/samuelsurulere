### Hi there, my name is **Samuel** ðŸ‘‹! It is a delight to have you visiting.

I transitioned to Data Science from a solid background in Applied Mathematics. I have been working as a Machine Learning Engineer with DataGap Analytics while working as an academic researcher. I made the final decision to fully transition into Data Science after landing in Canada in 2023. During my intermediate experience and learning on the job, I developed strong interests in data-driven solutions. Given that a Canadian degree/certificate would make employers trust the competencies of professional immigrants, I decided to attend the Lighthouse Labs bootcamp. After that, I landed a role at Pixeltree Inc.

#### Data Science journey so far...

After investing years of hardwork and mnetal exertion in academia, I felt it was time to transition to Data Science (ML and NLP) in particular. This is because I am quite passionate about solving real-world problems. But as much as I loved academia, I was only solving theoretical problems.

### Previous background

I have an extensive teaching experience as well as a solid research background in Applied Mathematics. This is my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Cu-AZD4AAAAJ&hl=en) if you'd like to see some of the publications I am proud of ;).

### Tech stack

These are some of the tech stacks I have learned and have proficiency in:
